This directory should be included in search path when compiling
with Borland C++ 5.0x compiler (maybe later ones, too).

It provides wrappers that force inclusion of STLport files without extensions.
If you want to preserve old-style HP semantics, include ../old_hp BEFORE this directory
to include HP-style STL headers (with "using" directives). If namespaces are disabled,
this one should be enough.
