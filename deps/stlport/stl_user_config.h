 *
 * To hold user-definable portion of STLport settings which may be overridden
 * on per-project basis.
 * Please note that if you use STLport iostreams (compiled library) then you have
 * to use consistent settings when you compile STLport library and your project. 
 * Those settings are defined in _site_config.h and have to be the same for a given
 * STLport installation.

//==========================================================

/* _STLP_NO_OWN_IOSTREAMS: 
 * __STL_NO_SGI_IOSTREAMS (in older versions)
 *  This is major configuration switch.
 *  Turn it on to disable use of SGI iostreams and use wrappers 
 *  around your compiler's iostreams, like before.
 *  Keep it off if you want to use  SGI iostreams 
 *  (Note that in this case you have to compile library in ../src
 *  and supply resulting library at link time).
 *
 */

// # define   _STLP_NO_OWN_IOSTREAMS	1


/* 
 * This macro only works in non-SGI iostreams mode.
 *
 * Uncomment to suppress using new-style streams even if they are
 * available.
 * Beware - _STLP_USE_OWN_NAMESPACE depends on this macro, too.
 * Do that only if you are absolutely sure backwards-compatible 
 * <iostream.h> is not actually a wrapper with <iostream>
 * Hint : In VC++ 6.x, they are not.
 */

// #define   _STLP_NO_NEW_IOSTREAMS	1

/*
 * Use this switch for embedded systems where no iostreams are available
 * at all. STLport own iostreams will also get disabled automatically then.
 */
# define _STLP_NO_IOSTREAMS 1

/* 
 * Set _STLP_DEBUG to turn the "Debug Mode" on.
 * That gets you checked iterators/ranges in the manner
 * of "Safe STL". Very useful for debugging. Thread-safe.
 * Please do not forget to link proper STLport library flavor
 * (e.g libstlport_gcc_stldebug.a) when you set this flag in STLport iostreams mode.
 */
// #define   _STLP_DEBUG 1


/* 
 *
 *  _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO : define this if you do not instantiate basic_xxx iostream classes  with custom types (which is most likely the case).
 *  Custom means types other than char, wchar and char_traits<>,
 *  like basic_ostream<my_char_type, my_traits<my_char_type> >
 *  When this option is on, most non-inline template functions definitions for iostreams are not seen by the client.
 *  Default is off, just not to break compilation for those who do use those types.
 *  which saves a lot of compile time for most compilers, also object and executable size for some.
 *  That also guarantees that you still use optimized standard i/o when you compile your program without optimization. 
 *  Option does not affect STLport library build; you may use the same binary library with and without this option, 
 *  on per-project basis.
 *

// #define _STLP_NO_CUSTOM_IO


/* 
 * _STLP_NO_RELOPS_NAMESPACE: if defined, don't put the relational
 * operator templates (>, <=. >=, !=) in namespace std::rel_ops, even
 * if the compiler supports namespaces.
 * Note : if the compiler do not support namespaces, those operators are not be provided by default,
 * to simulate hiding them into rel_ops. This was proved to resolve many compiler bugs with ambiguity.
 */

// #define _STLP_NO_RELOPS_NAMESPACE 1


/*
 * If _STLP_USE_OWN_NAMESPACE is in effect, STLport will try to rename std:: for the user
 * to _STL::. If you don't want this feature, or if it does not quite work for your
 * setup (like you are using third-party library that has to use vendor's STL), 
 * please define the following switch :
 */
// # define _STLP_DONT_REDEFINE_STD 1


/*
 * _STLP_WHOLE_NATIVE_STD : only meaningful in _STLP_USE_OWN_NAMESPACE mode.
 * Normally, STLport only imports necessary components from native std:: namespace -
 * those not yet provided by STLport (<iostream>, <complex>, etc.) 
 * and their dependencies (<string>, <stdexcept>). 
 * You might want everything from std:: being available in std:: namespace when you
 * include corresponding STLport header (like STLport <map> provides std::map as well, etc.),
 * if you are going to use both stlport:: and std:: components in your code.
 * Otherwise this option is not recommended as it increases the size of your object files
 * and slows down compilation.
 */
// # define _STLP_WHOLE_NATIVE_STD


/*
 * Use this option to catch uninitialized members in your classes.
 * When it is set, construct() and destroy() fill the class storage
 * with _STLP_SHRED_BYTE (see below). 
 * Note : _STLP_DEBUG and _STLP_DEBUG_ALLOC don't set this option automatically.
 */

// # define _STLP_DEBUG_UNINITIALIZED 1

/*
 * Uncomment and provide a definition for the byte with which raw memory
 * will be filled if _STLP_DEBUG_ALLOC or _STLP_DEBUG_UNINITIALIZED is defined. 
 * Choose a value which is likely to cause a noticeable problem if dereferenced 
 * or otherwise abused. A good value may already be defined for your platform; see
 * stl_config.h
 */
// #define _STLP_SHRED_BYTE 0xA3

/*
 *  This option is for gcc users only and only affects systems where native linker
 *  does not let gcc to implement automatic instantiation of static template data members/
 *  It is being put in this file as there is no way to check if we are using GNU ld automatically,
 *  so it becomes user's responsibility.
