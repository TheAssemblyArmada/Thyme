README file for "stlport/config/new_compiler"


This directory contains "configure" script which will help you to 
create config file for a new compiler. Please refer to HTML documentation
at www.stlport.org/doc for details. 
NOTE : stlconf.h produced by "configure" is NOT suitable for immediate use
as platform-specific configuration file as it does not set several important
macros. However, it is a good starting point.
